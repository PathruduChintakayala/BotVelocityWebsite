# Deterministic Orchestration and the Control Plane Model

Determinism does not eliminate model variability. It establishes execution boundaries so variability remains observable, governable, and recoverable.

## Explicit state transitions are foundational

A production workflow needs formal states such as `queued`, `running`, `awaiting_tool`, `retrying`, `failed`, and `completed`. These states define legal transitions and remove ambiguity during incident response.

When state is explicit, operators can answer critical questions immediately:

- where execution is stalled
- why a transition happened
- what action is safe next

## Control planes prevent distributed ownership conflicts

Without a control plane, multiple workers may act on the same run concurrently. This leads to split-brain retries, duplicate writes, and undefined final state.

Control planes establish authoritative ownership through lease enforcement and revision checks.

## Dead-letter queues are a reliability boundary

Some failures should not be retried indefinitely. Dead-letter queues provide a deterministic endpoint for runs that require policy updates, dependency remediation, or human review.

Each DLQ event should preserve:

- transition history
- failure classification
- execution context
- policy decisions

## Deterministic systems improve evaluation quality

Evaluation pipelines depend on reproducibility. Deterministic orchestration creates stable replay boundaries, making baseline comparisons and regression analysis statistically meaningful.

## Closing

The control plane model turns AI workflows from best-effort scripts into managed production systems.
