# The Governance Layer for Enterprise AI Systems

Most teams focus first on prompts, model choice, and tool integrations. Enterprise reliability depends on a different layer: governance.

## Policy enforcement must execute in-band

Governance controls are effective only when they participate directly in run execution. Examples include:

- tool allow-list and deny-list policies
- role-based action boundaries
- output handling constraints
- escalation and approval paths

Advisory controls applied after execution do not prevent production incidents.

## CI gates transform evaluation into an operating control

Evaluation should not be a periodic report. It should be an automated gate in deployment workflows, with explicit pass/fail criteria tied to baseline performance.

Effective gates typically include:

- regression threshold checks
- variance and drift analysis
- flaky behavior detection
- scenario-based score requirements

## Auditability is a core enterprise requirement

Security and compliance teams need evidence of who executed what, when, and under which policy decisions. Governance layers should produce traceable records without requiring manual reconstruction.

## Governance reduces operational and financial risk

By enforcing run-time controls and quality thresholds, governance layers reduce model misuse, workflow regressions, and unmanaged cost expansion.

## Closing

Prompts shape model behavior. Governance shapes production outcomes. Enterprise AI systems require both, with governance embedded in the control path.
